This library contains an implementation of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

While SHA-1 is no longer considered secure for general use, it is still useful on resource-constrained devices for certain use cases.

One example is in smart cards where a random challenge is generated by a verifier and the smart card digitally signs a payload that contains a SHA-1 hash based on the random challenge.
This is still reasonably secure because the time window available for brute-forcing a SHA-1 hash is extremely limited.

## Security Notice

SHA-1 is deprecated for most security-sensitive applications but retains utility in specific, time-bound scenarios.

## Usage

In your `Nargo.toml` file, add the following dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
sha1 = { tag = "v0.0.4", git = "https://github.com/michaelelliot/noir-sha1", directory = "crates/noir-sha1" }
```

Then use it in your Noir project like this:

```rust
use dep::sha1::sha1;

fn main(input: [u8; 128], input_len: u16, hash: pub [u8; 20]) {
    // Generate SHA-1 hash digest of input
    let compare_hash = sha1(input, input_len);
    assert(hash == compare_hash);
}
```

*NOTE:* The `input` parameter must be a `u8` byte array with a length that's a multiple of 64, such as 64, 128, 192, or 256 etc. (currently up to a maximum of 256).
The rest of the byte array can be zero-padded (`0x00`) as shown in the example below, with the `input_len` parameter specifying the number of initial bytes from the `input` to be used for calculating the digest.

Here's an example unit test for the `main` entrypoint above:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_main() {
    // Hal Finney was a cypherpunk pioneer
    let test_msg: [u8; 64] = [
        0x48, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x20, 0x46, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x6e,
        0x65, 0x79, 0x20, 0x77, 0x61, 0x73, 0x20, 0x61,
        0x20, 0x63, 0x79, 0x70, 0x68, 0x65, 0x72, 0x70,
        0x75, 0x6e, 0x6b, 0x20, 0x70, 0x69, 0x6f, 0x6e,
        0x65, 0x65, 0x72, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00];
    let test_hash: [u8; 20] =  [
        0x3a, 0x93, 0x96, 0x11, 0xee, 0x6e, 0x4d, 0xfb, 0xe2, 0x0e,
        0xc2, 0xcb, 0xf2, 0xa3, 0x55, 0x52, 0xbc, 0x47, 0x03, 0x4a];
    main(test_msg, 35, test_hash);
}
```
