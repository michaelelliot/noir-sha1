# Noir SHA-1

[![MIT License][license-shield]][license-url]

This library contains an implementation of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

While SHA-1 is no longer considered secure for general use, it is still useful on resource-constrained devices for certain use cases.

One example is in smart cards where a random challenge is generated by a verifier and the smart card digitally signs a payload that contains a SHA-1 hash based on the random challenge.
This is still reasonably secure because the time window available for brute-forcing a SHA-1 hash is extremely limited.

## Security Notice

SHA-1 is deprecated for most security-sensitive applications but retains utility in specific, time-bound scenarios.

## Usage

In your `Nargo.toml` file, add the following dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
sha1 = { git = "https://github.com/michaelelliot/noir-sha1", tag = "v0.0.1" }
```

Then use it in your Noir project like this:

```rust
use dep::sha1::{sha1};

fn main(input: [u8; 128], input_len: u16, hash: pub [u8; 20]) {
    // Generate SHA-1 hash digest of input
    let compare_hash = sha1(input, input_len);
    assert(hash == compare_hash);
}
```
