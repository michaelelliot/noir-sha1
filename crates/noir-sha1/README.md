# SHA-1

## Overview

This library contains an implementation of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

While SHA-1 is no longer considered secure for general use, it is still useful on resource-constrained devices for certain use cases.

One example is in smart cards where a random challenge is generated by a verifier and the smart card digitally signs a payload that contains a SHA-1 hash based on the random challenge.
This is still reasonably secure because the time window available for brute-forcing a SHA-1 hash is extremely limited.

## Security Notice

SHA-1 is deprecated for most security-sensitive applications but retains utility in specific, time-bound scenarios.
